## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parag8487/Code_review_platform.git
cd Code_review_platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd "live classroom"
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `live classroom` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Environment mode
NODE_ENV=development

# Site URL for Socket.IO connection
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd "live classroom"
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:5000

## üß™ Development

```bash
cd "live classroom"
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run lint    # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck # Run TypeScript type checking
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components
1. **Classroom Home**: Main dashboard for creating/joining classrooms
2. **Classroom Page**: Real-time collaborative coding environment
3. **Code Editor**: Dual-pane editor with permission controls
4. **User Roster**: Participant management interface
5. **Dialog Components**: Create/Join classroom dialogs

### Real-time Communication Flow
1. Users connect to Socket.IO server via `/api/socket_io`
2. Classroom data is synchronized through socket events
3. Code changes are broadcast to all participants in real-time
4. User actions (join/leave) update the participant roster
5. Permission requests flow from students to classroom owners
